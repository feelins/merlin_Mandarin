## How to transfer Mandarin TEXTS and PINYIN into merlin label format

This repository contains the Neural Network (NN) based Speech Synthesis System  
developed at the Centre for Speech Technology Research (CSTR), University of 
Edinburgh. 

I created a new question.hed for Mandarin project.
--------------------------------------------------

Merlin is a toolkit for building Deep Neural Network models for statistical parametric speech synthesis. 
It must be used in combination with a front-end text processor (e.g., Festival) and a vocoder (e.g., STRAIGHT or WORLD).

The system is written in Python and relies on the Theano numerical computation library.

Merlin comes with recipes (in the spirit of the [Kaldi](https://github.com/kaldi-asr/kaldi) automatic speech recognition toolkit) to show you how to build state-of-the art systems.

Merlin is free software, distributed under an Apache License Version 2.0, allowing unrestricted commercial and non-commercial use alike.
